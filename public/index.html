            <p>I started to work as a developer at the age of 14, I've been involved in several projects since 1999.</p>
	        <p>As a young developer, I lived the dot-com bubble, working in a very innovative Chilean project founded by Sillicon Valley's Cyclop Technologies Inc, in an artifitial intelligence, or search engine, related project.</p>
            <p>Always interested in technology, I started to work at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vtr.com">VTR</a>, developing applications for the first broadband provider in Chile from 2001-2004. After that, in 2004 I started to work in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tarreo.com">Tarreo</a>, a Chilean LanParty version, being part of the organisation of events up to 1000 gamers.</p>
            <p>In 2006 I founded my own development services company called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazinworks.com">AmazinWorks</a>, developing several web related projects for important Chilean companies until 2010.</p>
            <p>In 2007 I was part of a educational game development team called "Coleoptero" founded by <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Flores">Fernando Flores</a>, where I was the project leader in a Flash Multiplayer game called "Invención 2065."

            <p>At the end of 2008, I also worked as developer for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tigabytes.com">Tigabytes</a>, a Google Enterprise Partner in Chile. </p>
            <p>In 2010 I decided to create an startup with an innovation managment software, but we couldn't find customers or raise money in time.</p>
            <p>At the end of 2010 I worked as backend developer at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.piccsy.com">Piccsy.com</a>, a social network for image bookmarking and a Start-Up Chile first-round team. </p>

                Amazinworks was born as a service-oriented development agency, primarily focused on social networks development, web sites and corporate Intranets. Started without capital, in few months we had a development team, and had clients like USACH, Universidad Mayor and the Chilean Goverment. We entered also in the field of visual communication producing some audiovisual projects, including some sports programs for VTR, and internet programs as Firsttuesday TV. http://bit.ly/vuZzjY
                The most important challenge in Amazinworks, was the development of a software, which culminated in the development of a platform for innovation management oriented to large organizations called IDENET, for this project we raised initial capital through a technological partner. The prototype was implemented in some companies as COPEC, however, for business reasons as well Amazinworks IDENET could not be sustained over time and should close its activities in the second year.
